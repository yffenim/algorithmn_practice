# Write Method for: Count, Sum, and Print Tree given only its root

  # What is my input? The root.
  # What do I need to count? The entire tree. I need to find out how big the tree is.
  # What do I know about the root? That it has left or right values (and its own value). 
  # Everytime a left or right value exists, this means that there is a new node in the tree that I have discovered
  # So I need to track each new node
  # What is the repetitve aspect of this task? Checking if left or right node exists and incrementing the count by 1 if either exists. This can be done recursively
  # What is the problem with doing this recursively = what happens to my counter?
  # If the recursion is called, this means that I have found a node which means I can incremenet the count simultaneously to the recursion call by passing it in as an arguemt
  # This means that the logic for the recursion call has to be one cohesive entity and not separated by left and right?
  
  # pseudo-code: 
  # base case: no nodes left in node array because all children have been searched
  #
  # recursion:
  # remove the first array element because it is already counted
  # If left child exists or right child exists, 
  # increment count
  # add new node into node array
  # call recursion

  
def count(root, count=1, nodes=[root])

  # if there are no more nodes
  if nodes.empty?
    return count 
  else
  # set new root to the first node
    root = nodes.shift
  end 
    # recursion 
  if root.left != nil 
    count += 1
    nodes << root.left
  end 
  if root.right != nil
