# Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.


# Input: array of integers, an target integer
# Output: array containing the index of two numbers
# Definitions: nums can be negative
# Instructions: The target is the total of the indices of the two numbers.
# Methods:
# Edge Cases:

# IDEAS:
# - iterate through the array tracking with index 
#
