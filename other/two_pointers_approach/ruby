# Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.
#
# check the first element
# check the second element
# if they are the same, remove the first element from array
# if they are different, move onto next pair

  num.each_with_index.map do |x,i|
    if num[i] == num[i+1]
